## Objectives

The group hopes to use resturant data from the late 19th century to early 20th century in Manhattan to draw insights about immigrant patterns during that period.

To achive this goal, we divided our work into smaller subgroups:

## Data Augmentation -- Sarah

Expanding our dataset by scraping from the web.

## Cleaning Nationality and Gender data -- Cinny, Mary, Yinqui

Using [API](https://v2.namsor.com), [Ancestry](https://www.ancestry.com), [IPUMS](http://ipums.org) results to determine the nationality and gender of restuarant owners.

## Typical Resturant Owners -- Yinqui, Tracey

Reading from various sources to support insights drawn by data.

## Mapping / Visualizing Data Results -- Cinny, Sarah

Using GIS and d3 to map resturant data based on nationality and gender, and visualize the final results with d3.
