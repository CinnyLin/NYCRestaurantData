## [ipums](https://github.com/CinnyLin/NYCRestaurantData/tree/master/ipums)

This folder documents the attempt to check the validity of "nationality" data from [API](https://v2.namsor.com) results with [Ancestry](https://www.ancestry.com) data

[This notebook](https://github.com/CinnyLin/NYCRestaurantData/blob/master/ipums/ancestry.ipynb) is an example of cleaning nationality data in [1898_TrowBus.csv](https://github.com/CinnyLin/NYCRestaurantData/blob/master/ipums/1898TrowBus.csv) by cross checking nationality API results with Ancestry data (Ancestry_1910)

Other files in this folder are datasets extracted from [IPUMS](http://ipums.org) and attempts to decode those datasets.

## [mapping](https://github.com/CinnyLin/NYCRestaurantData/tree/master/mapping)

This folder shows the first draft of mapping restaurant data. The results were restaurant data of 9 nationalities (Chinese, French, German, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Polish, Russian, Spanish) from 3 time periods (1898, 1913, 2020) mapped in three separate Google Maps ([C-G](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1PFrfCr8KN_E1bWocsUiybxfq11Zbs78M&usp=sharing), [I-J](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1opZ0dKMtm1kpTYMN0ObGTQWiFt1jCDBZ&usp=sharing), [P-S](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1p7Xs9x1QeVIP-LyQsHSvK8M3nEMVazxq&usp=sharing)).
