## [ipums](https://github.com/CinnyLin/NYCRestaurantData/tree/master/ipums)

This folder documents the attempt to check the validity of "nationality" data from [API](https://v2.namsor.com) results with [Ancestry](https://www.ancestry.com) data

[This notebook](https://github.com/CinnyLin/NYCRestaurantData/blob/master/ipums/ancestry.ipynb) is an example of cleaning nationality data in [1898_TrowBus.csv](https://github.com/CinnyLin/NYCRestaurantData/blob/master/ipums/1898TrowBus.csv) by cross checking nationality API results with Ancestry data (Ancestry_1910)

Other files in this folder are datasets extracted from [IPUMS](http://ipums.org) and attempts to decode those datasets.
