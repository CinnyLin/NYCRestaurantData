## [mapping](https://github.com/CinnyLin/NYCRestaurantData/tree/master/mapping) -- Cinny

This folder shows the first draft of mapping restaurant data. The results were restaurant data of 9 nationalities (Chinese, French, German, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Polish, Russian, Spanish) from 3 time periods (1898, 1913, 2020) mapped in three separate Google Maps:

- [Chinese, French, German](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1PFrfCr8KN_E1bWocsUiybxfq11Zbs78M&usp=sharing)
- [Irish, Italian, Jewish](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1opZ0dKMtm1kpTYMN0ObGTQWiFt1jCDBZ&usp=sharing)
- [Polish, Russian, Spanish](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1p7Xs9x1QeVIP-LyQsHSvK8M3nEMVazxq&usp=sharing).

It is important to keep in mind that the reuslts had to be mapped separately because Google Maps only allow 10 layers per map while we have each nationalities in three different time periods (27 layers in total) so the results were arbitrarily separated by nationalities in alphabetical order.

It is also important to keep in mind that these results are not final since the nationality data was not cleaned when this was mapped and this was just a draft to understand how we can possibly visualize our dataset in an informative and insightful way.
